        <h2>My role</h2>
        <ul>
            <li> I am a Support Engineer for Stardust. I am excited about new technology and to be at Estee Lauder!</li>

        <h2> My background</h2>
        <li>I took a round about way into tech. Originally, I wanted to go into medicine. I did my BS degree in Biochemistry. I then worked for a few years to save up for midwifery school. At midwifery school, I attended nearly 100 births and delivered nearly 50 babies personally. I would eventually go on to deliver my sister's first baby. I worked in midwifery for a few years before needing to move on to another field. </li>
        <li>In 2019, I was looking for another field than science. I began to frequent the local hacker space to see friends of mine who were coders. They convinced me that if I was going to work in the space, I needed to learn to code. I began coding and immediately fell in love with technology.</li>
        <li>I took my first tech job in the beginning of 2020, right before COVID rocked everyone's world. I was the newest hire, so I was furloughed due to business loss. </li>
        <li>I used the time I was unemployed to go to Burlington Code Academy. I spent three months coding 40 hours a week, plus homework. </li>
        <li>I went on to get a support job at Vermont Systems. I worked on providing support for a Parks and Rec software. Yes, I rewatched Parks and Rec during this time. </li>
        <li>I started at Estee Lauder in November 2021.</li>
